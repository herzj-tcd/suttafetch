"Monks, these four persons are to be found existing in the world. Which four?
The unshakeable contemplative, the white-lotus contemplative, the red-lotus
contemplative, the most refined contemplative among contemplatives.

"And how is a person an unshakeable contemplative? There is the case where a

how a person is an unshakeable contemplative.
